[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/your-badge-id/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jasonross/deploys)

## 🌐 Overview

This is the repository for my personal website at [www.jasonross.dev](https://www.jasonross.dev) - a technology blog and portfolio built with Gatsby and hosted on Netlify.

## ✨ Features

- 📝 Blog posts with MDX support
- 🖼️ Image optimization with Cloudinary integration
- 🎨 Styled with styled-components
- 📊 Google Analytics 4 tracking
- 🔍 SEO optimized with sitemap and RSS feed
- 📱 Fully responsive design
- ⚡ Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline support

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Gatsby 5](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- **Styling**: [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- **Image Management**: [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
- **Deployment**: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v20.x (LTS)
- **npm**: v10.x or higher

> **Note**: This project uses [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for Node version management. The `.node-version` file specifies the required version.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jarossnd/jason-ross-dev-v2.git
cd jason-ross-dev-v2
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

> **Note**: The Wes Bos ESLint configuration requires Prettier 2 and TypeScript 4. Gatsby's ESLint dependencies are overridden to use ESLint 8, React ESLint config 7, and Flow plugin 8, matching the project's lint tooling. Keep these versions compatible when updating dependencies; `--force` and `--legacy-peer-deps` are not needed. Gatsby may still emit a peer warning for its experimental React server dependency; do not replace the project's stable React version with an experimental one to suppress it.

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Add your Cloudinary credentials:

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

> **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run develop
```

The site will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

GraphiQL IDE: [http://localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql)

## 🖼️ Cloudinary Setup

This project uses Cloudinary for image hosting and optimization:

1. Create a free account at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Get your credentials from the Cloudinary dashboard
3. Add them to your `.env` file
4. Images are sourced from the `website-pictures/` folder in your Cloudinary media library

## 🚢 Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to Netlify on every push to the `main` branch.

### Manual Deployment

```bash
npm run build
# Then deploy the public/ folder to your hosting service
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Google Analytics

Update the tracking ID in `gatsby-config.js`:

```javascript
{
  resolve: `gatsby-plugin-google-gtag`,
  options: {
    trackingIds: [
      'G-XXXXXXXXXX', // Replace with your GA4 ID
    ],
  },
}
```

### Site Metadata

Edit site information in `gatsby-config.js`:

```javascript
siteMetadata: {
  title: `Your Name`,
  description: `Your site description`,
  siteUrl: `https://yoursite.com`,
  // ...
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port 8000 is already in use

```bash
npm run clean
# Then start again
npm run develop
```

### Node version issues

Make sure you're using Node.js v20:

```bash
# If using fnm
fnm use 20

# If using nvm
nvm use 20
```

### Missing dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

This reinstalls dependencies from the committed lockfile. Keep `package-lock.json`
and use `npm install` after intentional dependency changes.

### Sharp native module is missing

If Gatsby reports that `sharp-linux-x64.node` is missing, Sharp's native
installation may have been skipped. On npm versions with install-script approval:

```bash
npm install-scripts approve sharp
npm rebuild sharp --foreground-scripts
```

Approved Sharp versions are recorded in `package.json` under `allowScripts`.
Review and approve the new versions when updating Sharp. On older npm versions
without `install-scripts`, use `npm rebuild sharp --ignore-scripts=false --foreground-scripts`.
Use Node.js 20 as specified by the project's version files. Do not install the
latest Sharp directly to repair Gatsby's transitive dependency.

## 📝 Writing Blog Posts

Blog posts are located in `blog/posts/` directory. Each post should:

1. Be in its own folder (e.g., `blog/posts/my-post/`)
2. Contain an `index.md` or `index.mdx` file
3. Include frontmatter with required fields:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2026-01-17"
description: "A brief description"
---
