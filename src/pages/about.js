          I enjoy anything that has to do with Linux based operating systems,
          coding, web servers, and everything in between. Some of my favorite
          utilities are VS Code, NeoVim, and Git. Occasionally, I also create
          technology videos on my YouTube channel found{' '}

          .

        <p>Besides technology I enjoy topics around discipline, military, productivity, genealogy, finance, and health and fitness. I also enjoy DIY projects from custom building a desk to building a back yard pergola.</p>

          In my younger years I started my own computer repair business when I was a young teenager
          making house calls and fixing computers for local businesses. I used
          to advertise my business with advertisements glued to the tops of
          pizza boxes at a local pizza restaurant. A few years later I was
          developing and designing websites while hosting the sites on my own web
          servers that I managed.

          Nowadays I work for a large software company helping people and
          customers get things done. I also have a family and I have a kid who is busy in sports.

          Sometimes I get questions about what hardware and software I use. You
          can view the stuff I use on my <Link to="/uses">uses</Link> page.
