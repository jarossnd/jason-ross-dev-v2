          I live in the United States in an area where summers are hot, winter
          are cold, and is windy all the time.

          I enjoy anything that has to do with Linux based operating systems,
          coding, web servers, and everything in between. Some of my favorite
          utilities are VS Code, NeoVim, and Git. Occasionally, I also create
          technology videos on my YouTube channel found{' '}

          I started my own computer repair business when I was a young teenager
          making house calls and fixing computers for local businesses. I used
          to advertise my business with advertisements glued to the tops of
          pizza boxes at a local pizza restaurant. A few years later I was
          developing and designing websites while hosting the sites on my own
          servers that I managed.

          Nowadays I work for a large software company helping people and
          customers get things done.

          Sometimes I get questions about what hardware and software I use. You
          can view the stuff I use on my <Link to="/uses">uses</Link> page.
