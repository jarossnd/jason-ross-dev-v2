## Overview

I just got done pushing updates to my website and here are the latest changes:

- I removed the Twitter feed from my homepage. I'm not a big fan of Twitter and don't do much with it so I decided to remove the Twitter feed that was on the homepage. Plus, it got annoying having to manually re-create the environment variable files every time I reinstalled my operating system since I do not check these files into my public Git repro because they contained my twitter secrets.
- I added a new page called Links to store my favorite websites.
- I updated the Donate page to include Monero and BitCoin will be coming soon.
- I added a topics tree to the homepage to replace the Twitter feed.
