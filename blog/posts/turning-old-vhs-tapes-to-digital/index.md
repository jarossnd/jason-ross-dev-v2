## Overview

My grandparents had an old Sharp VHS video recorder back in the early 90's and these old VHS tapes have been sitting around collecting dust for decades. Since they are now both passed away, I've been working on converting these old VHS tapes to digital.

I purchased 3 different hardware converters that all come with their own software that either run on Windows or Mac. I also put together an ffmpeg script to do the conversation using Linux. I used the Windows conversion software that came with Vidbox and seemed to work okay. I want to experiment with these converters with ffmpeg on Linux and see what the results are compared to using the Windows software.



For now, I have all the videos in a digital format and burned a DVD with all the videos. I can either double-click and watch the videos on a laptop or throw the DVD in a DVD player on the big screen and watch the old memories there.

My next goal is to see if I can do some after editing and clean-up with these movies to restore some of the color and other corrections that need to be made.

If anyone has done this before and has any tips, shoot me an email on my contact page and let me know.
