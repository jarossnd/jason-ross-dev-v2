As of January 2024, the MS-900 Microsoft 365 Fundamentals exam assesses your knowledge on describing cloud concepts, M365 apps and services, security, compliance, privacy, trust, pricing, licensing, and support. The only material I used to study for this exam was the documentation on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/ms-900/).

All previous exams I have taken in my career have been completed physically on location in a testing facility where you are monitored. The MS-900 was the first exam I did virtually where you have a proctor watch you take the exam using your webcam to ensure that the rules are followed. I also had to take pictures with my cell phone on each side of the room prior to the exam.

Although I cannot talk about what was on the exam, it went well. The Microsoft Learn documentation was helpful to look through prior to the exam. It also helped that I have experience with M365 because of my full-time job supporting the service.
