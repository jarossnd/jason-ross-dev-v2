## Overview

Last weekend we traveled to Valley City, ND for my son's hockey tournament. He plays for Angel's Hockey and is a termite. He had games on both Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday they played Jamestown, Mandan 3 and Mandan 1. The Angels won all 3 games. On Sunday the Angels played Mayport and Mandan 2. The Angels also won both of those games.
