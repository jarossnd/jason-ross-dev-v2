After 2 years of working from home, my place of work has finally fully opened again and I can now physically go back into the office. Below are some quick abservations when I went back.

1. I had a 2020 calendar hanging on my locker
2. Pictures and drawings hanging on the walls I had forgotten about
3. My monitor and peripheral setup at home is much better
4. An old Heinz plastic ketchup packet had turned a very dark red color
5. Not everyone is back in the office yet so it is very quiet.
6. I have been able to talk to a few folks that I haven't seen or heard from for two years

It has been good going back into the office because now I actually take the time and fully get ready for work instead of procrastinating and saying "I will just shower this afternoon" (just as an example) or whatever the excuse is.

I no longer have to wait for the coffee pot to make coffee since we have fancy coffee machines at work. Also, the coffee is free at work!

Since my home office setup put my office setup to shame, I went out and upgraded my work monitors, keyboard, and mouse. I purchased the same keyboard and mouse that I use at home for work so seamlessly go back and forth and not notice a typing difference.
