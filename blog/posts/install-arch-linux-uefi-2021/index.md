Howdy folks!

Lately, I have been diving more and more into Arch Linux and using suckless minimal software. I just finished publishing a video to YouTube called [Installing Arch Linux on a UEFI System in 2021](https://youtu.be/JFMGykeBfTI). In this video I walk you through from beginning to end on how to install Arch Linux when your machine is configured to use UEFI.

The other week I found an older HP laptop I had lying around that is around 5 years old. I couldn't remember the BIOS password and it was configured for UEFI. Instead of doing a password reset I decided to install Arch Linux on the laptop leaving UEFI in place. Once I successfully did that, I decided to make a video on it for others to follow.

Below are the steps on how I did the install. I have also included the instructions on GitHub [here](https://github.com/jarossnd/arch-linux-uefi-grub/blob/main/install-notes.md).

> Note: This article assumes you are using a US keyboard layout and we will also be setting up swap as a file instead of a partition. You should also read the official Arch installation guide https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide. 

1. Verify boot mode:
    - This is an important set when working with a UEFI system. Run the below command and if the directory does not exist, the system may not be booted in UEFI mode.
    - `ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars` (If the directory exist your computer supports EFI)

2. Ping some site on the Internet to verify connection:
    - Use `ip link` to verify your network devices
    - If necessary, use `iwctl` to setup your wireless
    - Run `ping` to check to see if you already have an internet connection
    - `ping archlinux.org -c 5`

3. Update system clock:
    - View the current status of your clock by running `timedatectl status`
    - Run the following command to ensure your system clock is correct `timedatectl set-ntp true`
    - This will set your date and time to update remotely using network time protocol

4. Go to [https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist](https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist) and find the closest mirror that supports HTTPS:
    - Add the mirrors on top of the `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` file.
    - `Server = https://mirror.arizona.edu/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch` (United States)

5. cfdisk

6. Create EFI partition:
    - New
    - 300M
    - Type
    - EFI System
    - Write

7. Create `/root` partition:
    - Select free space
    - New
    - 30G
    - Linux filesystem
    - Write

8. Create `/home` partition:
    - Select free space
    - New
    - Use rest of the space
    - Linux filesystem
    - Write

9. Create the filesystems:
    - `fdisk -l` to view the partitions for the next step
    - `mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1`
    - `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2`
    - `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3`
    - 

10. Create the `/root` and `/home` directories:
    - `mount /dev/sda2 /mnt`
    - `mkdir /mnt/home`
    - `mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/home`

11. Install Arch linux base packages:
    - Use the following if you want to include VIM:
    - `pacstrap -i /mnt base linux linux-firmware sudo vim`
    - Use the following if you want to also include Nano:
    - `pacstrap -i /mnt base linux linux-firmware sudo nano vim`

12. Generate the `/etc/fstab` file:
    - `genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab`

13. Chroot into installed system:
    - `arch-chroot /mnt`

14. Find available time zones:
    - `timedatectl list-timezones`
    
15. Set the timezone:
    - `ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago /etc/localtime`
    - or `timedatectl set-timezone America/Chicago`

16. Update the Hardware clock:
    - `hwclock --systohc`

17. Set your hostname and configure hosts
    - `echo myhostname > /etc/hostname`
    - Update `/etc/hosts` with the following:

```
127.0.0.1	localhost
::1		localhost
127.0.1.1	myhostname.localdomain	myhostname
```

18. Set the root password
    - `passwd`

19. Let's enable the network
    - If you don't do this before your reboot you won't have internet connection
    - `pacman -S networkmanager`
    - `systemctl enable NetworkManager`

20. Install boot manager and other needed packages:
    - `pacman -S grub efibootmgr dosfstools openssh os-prober mtools linux-headers linux-lts linux-lts-headers`

21. Set locale:
    - `sed -i 's/#en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/g' /etc/locale.gen` (uncomment en_US.UTF-8)
    - `locale-gen`

22. Enable root login via SSH:
    - `sed -i 's/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin yes/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    - `systemctl enable sshd.service`
    - `passwd` (for changing the root password)

23. Create EFI boot directory:
    - `mkdir /boot/EFI`
    - `mount /dev/sda1 /boot/EFI`

24. Install GRUB on EFI mode:
    - `grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --bootloader-id=grub_uefi --recheck`

25. Setup locale for GRUB:
    - `cp /usr/share/locale/en\@quot/LC_MESSAGES/grub.mo /boot/grub/locale/en.mo`

26. Write GRUB config:
    - `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`

27. Create swap file:
    - `fallocate -l 2G /swapfile`
    - `chmod 600 /swapfile`
    - `mkswap /swapfile`
    - `echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | tee -a /etc/fstab`

28. Exit, unount and reboot:
    - `exit`
    - `umount -a`
    - `reboot`
