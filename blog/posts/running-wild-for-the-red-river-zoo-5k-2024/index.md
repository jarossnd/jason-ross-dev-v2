On July 13th I participated in the Running Wild for the Red River Zoo 2024 5k. Past years they had almost 90 people who would register for the run. This year they had 165 runners registered. Below is an image of the starting line:

The 5k was a little short of a full 5k. From the starting line to finish my watch showed the total distance being 2.91 miles. The temperature was 73 degrees with an 85% humidity. Below is a map of the run:

The race started outside of the Zoo, and we went into the Zoo on the paths and did a full loop and then exited the Zoo. We then ran around the parking lot then out to 23rd Ave S and headed east. We then went south on 42nd street, went west on one of the avenues and returned to the Zoo. We finished by doing another lap in the Zoo and finishing right outside where we started.

It was a fun 5k race and I am planning on running it again next year.
