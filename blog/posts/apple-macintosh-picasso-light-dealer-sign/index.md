## Apple Macintosh 'Picasso' Light Dealer Sign

![Apple Macintosh 'Picasso' Light Dealer Sign](/assets/apple-macintosh-picasso-light.jpeg)

The Apple Macintosh 'Picasso" light is one of my most treasured items, and I was fortunate to receive the sign after the passing of my grandparents. I remember being a child and they would have this sign lit up in their computer office and it remained there all the way until their passing. Every time I look at this sign it reminds me of being in their house again.

My grandfather owned a computer store and it is my understanding that these signs were given to the original Macintosh dealers. It is also my understanding that there were 1500 dealers at the time so only 1500 'Picasso' signs would have been made and given to the original Macintosh dealers. Doing research online, it sounds like a few others received signs outside of the original dealers after the fact so there might ~2500 of these signs. You can read more information about that here.

The sign is lights up with a fluorescent light bulb. The tempered glass is 1/2" thick. The whole unit is 11.5" tall and 13" wide at base. The base is 2.25" tall, 3" deep, and 13" wide. The visible glass area is 9.25" tall, 10" wide, and 1/2" deep. The unit weights 6.2 lbs.
