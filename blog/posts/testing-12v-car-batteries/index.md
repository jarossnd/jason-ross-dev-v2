## Overview

This is a quick, straight to the point, article on how to test 12 volt car batteries with a Klein Tools digital mm700 auto-ranging multimeter.

## State of Charge

1. Plug the <font color="gray">Black</font> terminal into the "COM" jack
2. Plug the <font color="red">Red</font> terminal into the "VΩ" port
3. Connect terminals to car battery:
   - Negative battery post = <font color="gray">Black</font> terminal wire
   - Positive battery post = <font color="red">Red</font> terminal wire
4. Turn multimeter on by setting to: (AC/DC Volts)
   - Press the RANGE button until you get to the hundredth place
   - Press the SEL button until you get to: DC
5. Get current reading without the car turned on to find the state of the battery and compare to the state of charge chart

## Load Test

1. Plug the <font color="gray">Black</font> terminal into the "COM" jack
2. Plug the <font color="red">Red</font> terminal into the "VΩ" port
3. Connect terminals to car battery:
   - Negative battery post = <font color="gray">Black</font> terminal wire
   - Positive battery post = <font color="red">Red</font> terminal wire
4. Turn multimeter on by setting to: (AC/DC Volts)
   - Press the RANGE button until you get to the hundredth place
   - Press the SEL button until you get to: DC
5. Get current reading without the car turned on to find the state of the battery and compare to the state of charge chart
6. Turn car Headlights on for 2 minutes (to get rid of surface charge) and take another test
7. Hit the MAX/MIN button until MIN is on the screen and start the vehicle
8. Hit the HOLD button so we don’t lose the MIN value
9. Turn car off
10. Compare the MIN value with the load test voltage chart
