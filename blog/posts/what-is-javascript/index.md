## What is JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language for both the web and operating system (OS) that has evolved over the years. When JavaScript was first developed in 1995, it was a scripting language that allowed web developers to add code to their webpages to perform operations such as calculations, validations, and manipulation using a basic API (Application Programming Interfaces) feature set through the web browser JavaScript interpreter.

Today JavaScript is a full featured programming language not only for the web browser but OS as well. Newer technologies like Node.js allow JavaScript to run in a terminal, develop HTTP web servers, and utility software on the OS. Despite having “script” in its name, JavaScript has come a long way since its first introduction and is a serious programming language to consider.

Do not mix up JavaScript the Java programming language! They are two different things and should be treated as separate. Back in the day, JavaScript was created at Netscape and at the same time, Sun Microsystems had Java. The Java programming language was taking off and for marketing reasons, Netscape used JavaScript to call their scripting language.
