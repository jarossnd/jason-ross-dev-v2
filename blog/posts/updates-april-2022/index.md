## Personal Updates

Since the campus at my work has reopened, I have been busy getting up every morning and going to work. I spent a lot of time getting my desk and work area set up again. I purchased two new monitors, keyboard and mouse. For the most part, I'm happy with my setup at work and at home.

The weather is getting nice out again, so I am looking forward to planting my garden and doing updates and repairs around the house. I have a few pieces of sheetrock to replace inside the house due to minor water damage. I also have four missing soffits on the house I need to replace that blew off because of high winds.

I am also hoping to get a few new videos created on my YouTube channel within the coming weeks so keep an eye out.

## New Website Updates

I registered the domain of jason.cooking and launched a website containing some of the recipes I enjoy. This will allow me to have a nicely organized list of my recipes that I can share with family and friends when they ask for a recipe. I built jason.cooking using Gatsby with a simple blog template then customized the blog layout and added some CSS. I did put some recipes on the site, but I have a lot more to do. I also have a lot more to do with the CSS. My main goal was to get the site functionable to the point where I can start adding recipes and then make tweaks to the site later. My to do list for the site is as follows:

1. Mobile friendly with a hamburger icon
2. Have a print button feature
3. Allow comments for each recipe
4. Allow users to submit an issue or pull request on GitHub if there is a typo
5. A better overall CSS design for the site

I am hoping to implement more features on jason.cooking in the coming weeks so check back soon!
